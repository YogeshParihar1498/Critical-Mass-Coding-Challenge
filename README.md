 Inspiration

Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

1.Candaian Red Cross(https://www.redcross.ca/)
 In particular the idea behind  giving back to society and making the social service and its contribution by the virtue of technology inspired me the most.
 You hear a crisis at any where in  the world they are up with their ideas to help the affected area by the virtue of their digital platform.
 The online training modules in the website to empower a person for the social cause excites me the most.
 The overall and the main concept of giving back to society that has a wide role in the personality of each every human present on this planet inspired me the most.
 Apart from that the imagination of  the developers to create the website with plenty of functionality without making web page it look messy.
 
2.ProPet Ware (https://www.propetware.com/)
 Since my childhood i have been very close to pets(Dog's) and love to spent my time my time with them. But with a pet came a great responsibility.
 So by the virtue of the above mentioned website we can plan all the activities , medical attention ,grooming,  day-care our pet needs.
 Pet's are the one whom we can't understand by their speech so a regular check is a mandatory one for their well-being.
 The idea behind making a one stop solution impressed me the most and vaccine management that the product provides is very good functionality in today's busy world.
 And the  design of the website also gave me inspiration from design perspective.

 Focus

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

My prior work-experience and my skills are highly focused on the web-development domain I would be highly interested in using the this skills and try to make to contribution towards achieving the organisational goals.
In specific I’m well versed with the front-end technologies I would be highly motivated to learn the tech stack of the organisation and  new concepts that can give me a tremendous boost towards my technical skills.
In addition to the front-end I’m working to acquire knowledge about the back-end domain so i would be happy to get some knowledge in that domain. I’m pretty much open to learn new concepts and apply my logical thinking in solving the problems. And backend gives an exponential growth to your  logic building, other than that i would keep myself open to learn and implement the tech stack that organisation work on.
I will be focused on  contribute my time in working and connecting  with the team of the organisation  that would help me in giving the better understanding of the industry practices and would use that time to learn from the exposures of my seniors and co-workers and that would be great start for me as an intern to excel in career.
In a nut shell I would use all the provided resources to complete any task assigned to me and to boost my technical and interpersonal skills.
